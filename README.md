**Smart Thermoelectric Cooler**


Developed an intelligent thermoelectric cooling system capable of precisely controlling and maintaining temperature â€” without using a conventional refrigeration cycle.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Engineered a compact setup that can reach and hold any desired temperature with Â±1Â°C precision

Integrated a Peltier module with high-performance CPU fans for efficient cooling

Constructed a custom insulated chamber using laser-cut Rigifoam to minimize heat transfer

Designed a custom-built temperature sensor from scratch, complemented by an LM35 for ambient temperature monitoring

Implemented a magnetic door sensor that notifies the user if the door is left open or improperly sealed â€” ensuring consistent temperature control

ðŸ”¹ Control System:

Utilized an NI USB-6001 DAQ card to connect with sensors and manage control outputs

Developed the control program in LabVIEW, implementing a real-time closed-loop feedback mechanism

Leveraged LabVIEWâ€™s capabilities for live data visualization, adjustable temperature setpoints, and control logic to precisely modulate the Peltier moduleâ€™s power

Configured the DAQ card to process analog inputs from temperature sensors and provide digital outputs for actuators and the alert system.
